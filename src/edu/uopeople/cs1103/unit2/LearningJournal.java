/**
 * In many textbooks, the first examples of recursion are the mathematical functions factorial and fibonacci. These functions are defined for non-negative integers using the following recursive formulas:
 *
 * factorial(0) = 1
 * factorial(N) = N*factorial(N-1) for N > 0
 *
 * fibonacci(0) = 1
 * fibonacci(1) = 1
 * fibonacci(N) = fibonacci(N-1) + fibonacci(N-2) for N > 1
 *
 * Write recursive functions to compute factorial(N) and fibonacci(N) for a given non-negative integer N, and write a main() routine to test your functions.
